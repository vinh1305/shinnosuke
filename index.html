Introduction and Overview.</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>This Privacy Policy describes how Type/Code LLC (&ldquo;Company,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;our,&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo;) collects, uses, and shares information about you and applies to your use of any online service location that posts a link to this Privacy Policy and all features, content, and other services that we own, control and make available through such online service location (collectively, the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;). This Privacy Policy does not apply to our information collection activities outside of the Service (unless otherwise stated below or at the time of collection).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By using the Service, you agree to our Terms of Use and to our collection, use and disclosure practices, and other activities as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree and consent, discontinue use of the Service. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>2. Information Collection.</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>A. Information You Provide.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We and our Service Providers (defined below) may collect information you provide directly via the Service. For example, we collect information when you provide us with your email address, access our content, share or upload content to our Service or use the features of our Service to produce customized content, or otherwise communicate or transact with us through the Service.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The information we collect may include Personal Information. &quot;Personal Information&quot; is information that identifies you personally (whether alone or in combination), such as your first and last name, e-mail address, phone number, and postal address. You may choose to voluntarily submit certain other information to us through the Service, including Personal Information, but you are solely responsible for your own Personal Information in instances where we have not requested that you submit such information to us. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certain areas of the Service, such as our customizable countdown timers, are designed to allow you to share or upload content to our Service or use features of our Service to produce customized content, and as a result, any information you share may be publicly available. If you make information public through our Service, other users will have access to it and it will not be treated as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. Please think carefully before making information public. You are solely responsible for information you make public.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some cases, if you provide information to us about a friend, we may use that information to fulfill a request by you, such as sending an e-mail to your friend&rsquo;s e-mail address inviting him or her to join the Service. By using this functionality, you acknowledge and agree that both you and your friend are based in the United States and that you have your friend&rsquo;s consent for us to use his or her contact information to fulfill your request.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Personal Information once &ldquo;de-identified&rdquo; is not subject to this Privacy Policy and we and our Service Providers may treat it as non-Personal Information and use it without obligation to you except as prohibited by applicable law. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>B. Information Collected Automatically.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We and our Service Providers may automatically collect certain information about you when you access or use the Service (&ldquo;Usage Information&rdquo;). Usage Information may include IP address, device identifier, browser type, operating system, data regarding network connected hardware, and information about your use of the Service. To the extent that we combine Usage Information with your Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The methods that may be used on the Service to collect Usage Information include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Log Information: Log information is data about your use of the Service, such as IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and related data, which is stored in log files.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Information Collected by Tracking Technologies: Cookies, web beacons (also known as &quot;tracking pixels&quot;), embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, voice processing technologies, device fingerprinting, in-app tracking methods, and other tracking technologies now and hereafter developed (&ldquo;Tracking Technologies&rdquo;) may be used to collect information about your interactions with the Service or e-mails, including information about your browsing and activity behavior.&nbsp;\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Cookies<br />\r\n\t\tA cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user&rsquo;s device, which may be a session ID cookie or tracking cookie. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Service and expire when you close your browser. Tracking cookies help in understanding how you use the Service, and remain longer. The Service may associate some or all of these types of cookies with your devices. Cookies may remain on your device for extended periods of time.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Web Beacons (&ldquo;Tracking Pixels&rdquo;)<br />\r\n\t\tWeb beacons are small graphic images, also known as &quot;internet tags&quot; or &quot;clear gifs,&quot; embedded in web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be used to count the number of visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, and to count content views.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Embedded Scripts<br />\r\n\t\tAn embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service. It is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third party with whom we work, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and deleted or deactivated thereafter.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Location-identifying Technologies<br />\r\n\t\tGPS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering, and other location-aware technologies locate (sometimes precisely) you for purposes such as verifying your location and delivering or restricting relevant content based on your location.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Device Fingerprinting. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t\tDevice fingerprinting is the process of analyzing and combining sets of information elements from your device&rsquo;s browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, in order to create a &ldquo;fingerprint&rdquo; of your device and uniquely identify your device and applications.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>In-App Tracking Methods.<br />\r\n\t\tThere are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in mobile apps, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifier, or other identifiers such as &ldquo;Ad IDs&rdquo; to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps.</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Some information about your use of the Service and certain Third Party Services (defined below) may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and services and used by us and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use, and deliver relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Service and certain Third Party Services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For further information on Tracking Technologies and your choices regarding them, please see &ldquo;Third Party Services, Features, and Devices&rdquo; and &ldquo;Your Rights and Choices&rdquo; below.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>C. Information from Other Sources.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We may obtain information about you from other sources, including Service Providers and Third Party Services, and combine such information with information we have collected about you. To the extent we combine such third party sourced information with Personal Information we have collected about you on the Service, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the accuracy of any information provided by third parties or third party policies or practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>3. Use of Information.</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>We may use information about you, including your Personal Information, for any purposes consistent with our statements under this Privacy Policy or as permitted by applicable law, including to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Manage our Service, including your registration and account;</li>\r\n\t<li>Generate customized, sharable content as a feature of the Service;</li>\r\n\t<li>Respond to your comments, questions, and requests, and provide customer service;</li>\r\n\t<li>Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, information regarding changes to our policies, and support and administrative messages;</li>\r\n\t<li>Prevent and address fraud, breach of policies or terms, and threats or harm;&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Monitor and analyse trends, usage, and activities;</li>\r\n\t<li>Conduct research, including focus groups and surveys;&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Improve the Service or other Company websites, applications, marketing efforts, products and services;&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Send you advertisements and communicate with you regarding our and third party products, services, offers, promotions, rewards and events we think you may be interested in (for information about how to manage these communications and marketing efforts, please see &ldquo;Your Rights and Choices&rdquo; below); and&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Fulfill any other purpose disclosed at the time you provide Personal Information.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h1>4. Sharing of Information.</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Our agents, vendors, consultants, and other service providers, including payment processors (collectively &ldquo;Service Providers&rdquo;) may receive, or be given access to your information, including Personal Information and Usage Information, in connection with their work on our behalf. These Service Providers are prohibited from using your Personal Information for any purpose other than to provide this assistance, although we may permit them to use aggregate information which does not identify you or de-identified data for other purposes. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We may also share information about you with third parties for any purposes consistent with our statements under this Privacy Policy or as permitted by applicable law, including as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>To comply with the law or other legal process, and where required, in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements;</li>\r\n\t<li>To protect the rights, property, life, health, security and safety of us, the Service or any third party;&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>In connection with, or during negotiations of, any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale or any other type of acquisition or business combination of all or any portion of our assets, or transfer of all or a portion of our business to another business;</li>\r\n\t<li>With our affiliates for internal business purposes;</li>\r\n\t<li>With our affiliates, business partners, and other third parties for their own business purposes, including direct marketing purposes (California residents have certain rights set forth in &ldquo;Your California Privacy Rights&rdquo; below);</li>\r\n\t<li>For purposes disclosed at the time you provide Personal Information; and</li>\r\n\t<li>With your consent or at your direction.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Without limiting the foregoing, in our sole discretion, we may share aggregated information which does not identify you or de-identified information about you with third parties or affiliates for any purpose. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>5.&nbsp;Sweepstakes, Contests, Promotions.</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>We may offer sweepstakes, contests, surveys, and other promotions (each, a &ldquo;Promotion&rdquo;) jointly sponsored or offered by third parties that may require submitting Personal Information. If you voluntarily choose to enter a Promotion, your Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties for administrative purposes and as required by law (e.g., on a winners list). By entering, you agree to the official rules that govern that Promotion, and may, except where prohibited by applicable law, allow the sponsor and/or other parties to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>6. Third Party Services, Features, and Devices.</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Service contains content from and hyperlinks to websites, locations, platforms, and services operated and owned by third parties (&ldquo;Third Party Services&rdquo;). In addition, our Service contains features that allow you to interact with, connect to, or access our Service through certain Third Party Services and third party devices (&ldquo;Third Party Features&rdquo;). You use a Third Party Feature when you &ldquo;like&rdquo; or &ldquo;share&rdquo; content over social media through our Service, such as when you share or embed our countdown timers on a social media platform. Remember that third parties may use Tracking Technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit Personal Information from you. Also, if you use a Third Party Feature, both we and the applicable third party may have access to and use information associated with your use of the Third Party Feature. If you publicly reference our Service on a Third Party Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Company in a tweet or post), we may use your reference on or in connection with our Service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Service also contains Tracking Technologies operated by third parties. For example, analytics services, such as Google Analytics, may use Tracking Technologies on our Service to help us analyze your use of the Service, compile statistic reports on the Service&rsquo;s activity, and provide other services relating to Service activity and internet usage. Similarly, ad serving services, advertisers, and other third parties may use Tracking Technologies on our Service and Third Party Services to track your activities across time and services, and tailor ads to you based on your activities, which may include sending you an ad on a Third Party Service or third party device after you have left the Service (&ldquo;Interest-based Advertising&rdquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The information collected and stored by third parties, whether through our Service, a Third Party Service, a Third Party Feature, or a third party device, remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they share with us, your choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. We are not responsible for and make no representations regarding third party policies and practices, and encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use. To the extent we combine information we receive from third parties with Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For further information on Tracking Technologies and your choices regarding them, please see &ldquo;Information Collected Automatically&rdquo; above and &ldquo;Your Rights and Choices&rdquo; below.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>7. Your Rights and Choices.&nbsp;</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>A. Accessing Your Information.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You may access, update, or remove certain account information that you have voluntarily submitted to us through the Service by sending an e-mail to us here. We may require additional information from you to allow us to confirm your identity. Please note that we will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. California residents have additional rights set forth in &ldquo;Your California Privacy Rights&rdquo; below.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>B. Tracking Technologies Generally.&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. &nbsp;Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. With respect to our mobile apps, you can stop all collection of information via an app by uninstalling the app. &nbsp;Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain location-based services, by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please be aware that if you disable or remove Tracking Technologies some parts of the Service may not work and that when you revisit the Service your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; signal to online services you visit. &nbsp;Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, we do not monitor or take action with respect to &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; signals or other mechanisms. &nbsp;For more information on &ldquo;Do Not Track,&rdquo; visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A. Analytics and Advertising Tracking Technologies.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may exercise choices regarding receipt of Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt outs. &nbsp;Some of the advertisers and Service Providers that perform advertising-related services for us and our partners may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (&quot;DAA&quot;) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices, and http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices for information on the DAA&rsquo;s opt out program for mobile apps. &nbsp;Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (&ldquo;NAI&rdquo;). To learn more about the NAI and your opt out options for their members, see http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. &nbsp;Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Company is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties&rsquo; opt out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>B. Communications.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You can opt-out of receiving certain promotional communications (e-mails and push notifications) from us at any time by (i) for e-mails, following the instructions as provided in e-mails to click on the unsubscribe link, or contacting us here with the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject field of the e-mail; and (ii) for push notifications or in-app messages, adjusting the permissions in your mobile device. Please note that your opt-out is limited to the e-mail address and device used and will not affect subsequent subscriptions or, for e-mails, non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, transactions, servicing, or Company&rsquo;s ongoing business relations. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a id=\"california-privacy-rights\" name=\"california-privacy-rights\"></a>C. Your California Privacy Rights.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>California&rsquo;s &ldquo;Shine the Light&rdquo; law permits customers in California to request certain details about how certain types of their information are shared with third parties and, in some cases, affiliates, for those third parties&rsquo; and affiliates&rsquo; own direct marketing purposes. Under the law, a business should either provide California customers certain information upon request or permit California customers to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Company may share personal information as defined by California&rsquo;s &ldquo;Shine the Light&rdquo; law with third parties and/or affiliates for such third parties&rsquo; and affiliates&rsquo; own direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and wish to obtain information about our compliance with this law, please e-mail us here or send us a letter to Type/Code LLC, 20 Jay Street, Suite 924, Brooklyn, NY 11201.

Requests must state that the user personally posted such content or information and detail where the content or information is posted. We will make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>8. Children.</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>The Service is intended for a general audience and not directed to children under thirteen (13) years of age. Company does not knowingly collect personal information as defined by the U.S. Children&rsquo;s Privacy Protection Act (&ldquo;COPPA&rdquo;) in a manner that is not permitted by COPPA.

Data Security.</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of your information collected through our Service.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>10. International Transfer.</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>We are based in the U.S. and the information we and our Service Providers collect is governed by U.S. law. &nbsp;If you are accessing the Service from outside of the U.S., please be aware that information collected through the Service may be transferred to, processed, stored and used in the U.S. &nbsp;Data protection laws in the U.S. may be different from those of your country of residence. Your use of the Service or provision of any information therefore constitutes your consent to the transfer to and from, processing, usage, sharing and storage of your information, including Personal Information, in the U.S. as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>11. Changes to this Privacy Policy.</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>We reserve the right to revise and reissue this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting of the revised Privacy Policy. Your continued use of our Service indicates your consent to the Privacy Policy then posted. If the changes are material, we may provide you additional notice to your e-mail address. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>12.

Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Arbitration Procedures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision. Arbitration shall be initiated through JAMS. &nbsp;Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in front of one arbitrator. &nbsp;If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in this Terms will govern. The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from JAMS at www.jamsadr.com or 1-800-352-5267. &nbsp;To initiate arbitration, you or Company must do the following things:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(1) &nbsp; &nbsp;Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(2) &nbsp; &nbsp;Send three copies of the demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to: JAMS to your local JAMS office or to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, CA 94111.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(3) &nbsp; &nbsp;Send one copy of the demand for Arbitration to the other party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. If travelling to New York is a burden, you may participate in the arbitration by phone or via document submission to the fullest extent allowable by the arbitrator. Each party will bear their own costs of arbitration unless the arbitrator directs that bearing such costs would be an undue burden and in that case, we will pay for your portion of the arbitration administrative costs (but not your attorneys&rsquo; fees). Arbitration under this agreement shall be held in the United States in New York, NY under New York law without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The arbitration may award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive relief). Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Authority of Arbitrator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No Class Actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>F.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Choice of Law/Forum Selection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any circumstances where the Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes permits the parties to litigate in court, these Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflict of law rules. You further expressly consent and agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of a court of competent jurisdiction located in New York, NY.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN &quot;AS IS,&quot; &quot;AS AVAILABLE,&quot; AND &quot;WITH ALL FAULTS&quot; BASIS.

Company reserves the right to assume, at your expense, the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you. You agree to cooperate with Company&rsquo;s defense of any claim. You will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of Company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This provision does not require you to indemnify us for any unconscionable commercial practice by us or for our fraud, deception, false promise, misrepresentation or concealment, suppression or omission of any material fact in connection with the Service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Injunctive or other Equitable Relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN AN INJUNCTION OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND, SUCH AS ANY COURT OR OTHER ACTION THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEBSITE, APPLICATION, CONTENT, SUBMISSIONS, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED, LICENSED, USED OR CONTROLLED BY COMPANY OR A LICENSOR OF COMPANY.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Updates to Terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reserve the right, at any time in our sole discretion, to modify or replace any part of these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, without prior notice. You agree that we may notify you of any updated Terms and any applicable Additional Terms by posting them on the Service so that they are accessible via a link from the home page, and/or to send you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us. All such changes are effective immediately when we post them, or such later date as may be specified in the notice of updated Terms and any applicable Additional Terms.

Introduction and Overview.</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>This Privacy Policy describes how Type/Code LLC (&ldquo;Company,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;our,&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo;) collects, uses, and shares information about you and applies to your use of any online service location that posts a link to this Privacy Policy and all features, content, and other services that we own, control and make available through such online service location (collectively, the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;). This Privacy Policy does not apply to our information collection activities outside of the Service (unless otherwise stated below or at the time of collection).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By using the Service, you agree to our Terms of Use and to our collection, use and disclosure practices, and other activities as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree and consent, discontinue use of the Service. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>2. Information Collection.</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>A. Information You Provide.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We and our Service Providers (defined below) may collect information you provide directly via the Service. For example, we collect information when you provide us with your email address, access our content, share or upload content to our Service or use the features of our Service to produce customized content, or otherwise communicate or transact with us through the Service.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The information we collect may include Personal Information. &quot;Personal Information&quot; is information that identifies you personally (whether alone or in combination), such as your first and last name, e-mail address, phone number, and postal address. You may choose to voluntarily submit certain other information to us through the Service, including Personal Information, but you are solely responsible for your own Personal Information in instances where we have not requested that you submit such information to us. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certain areas of the Service, such as our customizable countdown timers, are designed to allow you to share or upload content to our Service or use features of our Service to produce customized content, and as a result, any information you share may be publicly available. If you make information public through our Service, other users will have access to it and it will not be treated as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. Please think carefully before making information public. You are solely responsible for information you make public.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some cases, if you provide information to us about a friend, we may use that information to fulfill a request by you, such as sending an e-mail to your friend&rsquo;s e-mail address inviting him or her to join the Service. By using this functionality, you acknowledge and agree that both you and your friend are based in the United States and that you have your friend&rsquo;s consent for us to use his or her contact information to fulfill your request.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Personal Information once &ldquo;de-identified&rdquo; is not subject to this Privacy Policy and we and our Service Providers may treat it as non-Personal Information and use it without obligation to you except as prohibited by applicable law. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>B. Information Collected Automatically.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We and our Service Providers may automatically collect certain information about you when you access or use the Service (&ldquo;Usage Information&rdquo;). Usage Information may include IP address, device identifier, browser type, operating system, data regarding network connected hardware, and information about your use of the Service. To the extent that we combine Usage Information with your Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The methods that may be used on the Service to collect Usage Information include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Log Information: Log information is data about your use of the Service, such as IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and related data, which is stored in log files.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Information Collected by Tracking Technologies: Cookies, web beacons (also known as &quot;tracking pixels&quot;), embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, voice processing technologies, device fingerprinting, in-app tracking methods, and other tracking technologies now and hereafter developed (&ldquo;Tracking Technologies&rdquo;) may be used to collect information about your interactions with the Service or e-mails, including information about your browsing and activity behavior.&nbsp;\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Cookies<br />\r\n\t\tA cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user&rsquo;s device, which may be a session ID cookie or tracking cookie. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Service and expire when you close your browser. Tracking cookies help in understanding how you use the Service, and remain longer. The Service may associate some or all of these types of cookies with your devices. Cookies may remain on your device for extended periods of time.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Web Beacons (&ldquo;Tracking Pixels&rdquo;)<br />\r\n\t\tWeb beacons are small graphic images, also known as &quot;internet tags&quot; or &quot;clear gifs,&quot; embedded in web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be used to count the number of visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, and to count content views.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Embedded Scripts<br />\r\n\t\tAn embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service. It is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third party with whom we work, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and deleted or deactivated thereafter.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Location-identifying Technologies<br />\r\n\t\tGPS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering, and other location-aware technologies locate (sometimes precisely) you for purposes such as verifying your location and delivering or restricting relevant content based on your location.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Device Fingerprinting. &nbsp;<br />\r\n\t\tDevice fingerprinting is the process of analyzing and combining sets of information elements from your device&rsquo;s browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, in order to create a &ldquo;fingerprint&rdquo; of your device and uniquely identify your device and applications.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>In-App Tracking Methods.<br />\r\n\t\tThere are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in mobile apps, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifier, or other identifiers such as &ldquo;Ad IDs&rdquo; to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps.</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Some information about your use of the Service and certain Third Party Services (defined below) may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and services and used by us and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use, and deliver relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Service and certain Third Party Services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For further information on Tracking Technologies and your choices regarding them, please see &ldquo;Third Party Services, Features, and Devices&rdquo; and &ldquo;Your Rights and Choices&rdquo; below.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>C. Information from Other Sources.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We may obtain information about you from other sources, including Service Providers and Third Party Services, and combine such information with information we have collected about you. To the extent we combine such third party sourced information with Personal Information we have collected about you on the Service, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the accuracy of any information provided by third parties or third party policies or practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>3. Use of Information.</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>We may use information about you, including your Personal Information, for any purposes consistent with our statements under this Privacy Policy or as permitted by applicable law, including to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Manage our Service, including your registration and account;</li>\r\n\t<li>Generate customized, sharable content as a feature of the Service;</li>\r\n\t<li>Respond to your comments, questions, and requests, and provide customer service;</li>\r\n\t<li>Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, information regarding changes to our policies, and support and administrative messages;</li>\r\n\t<li>Prevent and address fraud, breach of policies or terms, and threats or harm;&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Monitor and analyse trends, usage, and activities;</li>\r\n\t<li>Conduct research, including focus groups and surveys;&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Improve the Service or other Company websites, applications, marketing efforts, products and services;&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Send you advertisements and communicate with you regarding our and third party products, services, offers, promotions, rewards and events we think you may be interested in (for information about how to manage these communications and marketing efforts, please see &ldquo;Your Rights and Choices&rdquo; below); and&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Fulfill any other purpose disclosed at the time you provide Personal Information.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h1>4. Sharing of Information.</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Our agents, vendors, consultants, and other service providers, including payment processors (collectively &ldquo;Service Providers&rdquo;) may receive, or be given access to your information, including Personal Information and Usage Information, in connection with their work on our behalf. These Service Providers are prohibited from using your Personal Information for any purpose other than to provide this assistance, although we may permit them to use aggregate information which does not identify you or de-identified data for other purposes. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We may also share information about you with third parties for any purposes consistent with our statements under this Privacy Policy or as permitted by applicable law, including as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>To comply with the law or other legal process, and where required, in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements;</li>\r\n\t<li>To protect the rights, property, life, health, security and safety of us, the Service or any third party;&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>In connection with, or during negotiations of, any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale or any other type of acquisition or business combination of all or any portion of our assets, or transfer of all or a portion of our business to another business;</li>\r\n\t<li>With our affiliates for internal business purposes;</li>\r\n\t<li>With our affiliates, business partners, and other third parties for their own business purposes, including direct marketing purposes (California residents have certain rights set forth in &ldquo;Your California Privacy Rights&rdquo; below);</li>\r\n\t<li>For purposes disclosed at the time you provide Personal Information; and</li>\r\n\t<li>With your consent or at your direction.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Without limiting the foregoing, in our sole discretion, we may share aggregated information which does not identify you or de-identified information about you with third parties or affiliates for any purpose. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>5.&nbsp;Sweepstakes, Contests, Promotions.</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>We may offer sweepstakes, contests, surveys, and other promotions (each, a &ldquo;Promotion&rdquo;) jointly sponsored or offered by third parties that may require submitting Personal Information. If you voluntarily choose to enter a Promotion, your Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties for administrative purposes and as required by law (e.g., on a winners list). By entering, you agree to the official rules that govern that Promotion, and may, except where prohibited by applicable law, allow the sponsor and/or other parties to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>6. Third Party Services, Features, and Devices.</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Service contains content from and hyperlinks to websites, locations, platforms, and services operated and owned by third parties (&ldquo;Third Party Services&rdquo;). In addition, our Service contains features that allow you to interact with, connect to, or access our Service through certain Third Party Services and third party devices (&ldquo;Third Party Features&rdquo;). You use a Third Party Feature when you &ldquo;like&rdquo; or &ldquo;share&rdquo; content over social media through our Service, such as when you share or embed our countdown timers on a social media platform. Remember that third parties may use Tracking Technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit Personal Information from you. Also, if you use a Third Party Feature, both we and the applicable third party may have access to and use information associated with your use of the Third Party Feature. If you publicly reference our Service on a Third Party Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Company in a tweet or post), we may use your reference on or in connection with our Service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Service also contains Tracking Technologies operated by third parties. For example, analytics services, such as Google Analytics, may use Tracking Technologies on our Service to help us analyze your use of the Service, compile statistic reports on the Service&rsquo;s activity, and provide other services relating to Service activity and internet usage. Similarly, ad serving services, advertisers, and other third parties may use Tracking Technologies on our Service and Third Party Services to track your activities across time and services, and tailor ads to you based on your activities, which may include sending you an ad on a Third Party Service or third party device after you have left the Service (&ldquo;Interest-based Advertising&rdquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The information collected and stored by third parties, whether through our Service, a Third Party Service, a Third Party Feature, or a third party device, remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they share with us, your choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. We are not responsible for and make no representations regarding third party policies and practices, and encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use. To the extent we combine information we receive from third parties with Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For further information on Tracking Technologies and your choices regarding them, please see &ldquo;Information Collected Automatically&rdquo; above and &ldquo;Your Rights and Choices&rdquo; below.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>7. Your Rights and Choices.&nbsp;</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>A. Accessing Your Information.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You may access, update, or remove certain account information that you have voluntarily submitted to us through the Service by sending an e-mail to us here.

California residents have additional rights set forth in &ldquo;Your California Privacy Rights&rdquo; below.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>B. Tracking Technologies Generally.&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. &nbsp;Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. With respect to our mobile apps, you can stop all collection of information via an app by uninstalling the app. &nbsp;Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain location-based services, by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please be aware that if you disable or remove Tracking Technologies some parts of the Service may not work and that when you revisit the Service your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; signal to online services you visit. &nbsp;Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, we do not monitor or take action with respect to &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; signals or other mechanisms. &nbsp;For more information on &ldquo;Do Not Track,&rdquo; visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A.

To learn more about the NAI and your opt out options for their members, see http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. &nbsp;Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Company is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties&rsquo; opt out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>B.

Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Arbitration Procedures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision. Arbitration shall be initiated through JAMS. &nbsp;Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in front of one arbitrator. &nbsp;If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in this Terms will govern. The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from JAMS at www.jamsadr.com or 1-800-352-5267. &nbsp;To initiate arbitration, you or Company must do the following things:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(1) &nbsp; &nbsp;Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(2) &nbsp; &nbsp;Send three copies of the demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to: JAMS to your local JAMS office or to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, CA 94111.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(3) &nbsp; &nbsp;Send one copy of the demand for Arbitration to the other party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. If travelling to New York is a burden, you may participate in the arbitration by phone or via document submission to the fullest extent allowable by the arbitrator. Each party will bear their own costs of arbitration unless the arbitrator directs that bearing such costs would be an undue burden and in that case, we will pay for your portion of the arbitration administrative costs (but not your attorneys&rsquo; fees). Arbitration under this agreement shall be held in the United States in New York, NY under New York law without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The arbitration may award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive relief). Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Authority of Arbitrator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No Class Actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>F.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Choice of Law/Forum Selection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any circumstances where the Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes permits the parties to litigate in court, these Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflict of law rules. You further expressly consent and agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of a court of competent jurisdiction located in New York, NY.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN &quot;AS IS,&quot; &quot;AS AVAILABLE,&quot; AND &quot;WITH ALL FAULTS&quot; BASIS.

Company reserves the right to assume, at your expense, the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you. You agree to cooperate with Company&rsquo;s defense of any claim. You will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of Company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This provision does not require you to indemnify us for any unconscionable commercial practice by us or for our fraud, deception, false promise, misrepresentation or concealment, suppression or omission of any material fact in connection with the Service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Injunctive or other Equitable Relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN AN INJUNCTION OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND, SUCH AS ANY COURT OR OTHER ACTION THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEBSITE, APPLICATION, CONTENT, SUBMISSIONS, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED, LICENSED, USED OR CONTROLLED BY COMPANY OR A LICENSOR OF COMPANY.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Updates to Terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reserve the right, at any time in our sole discretion, to modify or replace any part of these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, without prior notice. You agree that we may notify you of any updated Terms and any applicable Additional Terms by posting them on the Service so that they are accessible via a link from the home page, and/or to send you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us. All such changes are effective immediately when we post them, or such later date as may be specified in the notice of updated Terms and any applicable Additional Terms. If you object to any such changes, your sole recourse is to cease using the Service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;General Provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Consent or Approval.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No Company consent or approval may be deemed to have been granted by Company without being in writing and signed by an officer of Company. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Survival.<br />\r\nThe provisions of these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, which by their nature should survive termination of your use of the Service, including sections on Service Use (except for the limited license), Unsolicited Submissions, Copyright Infringement, Subscriptions and Products, Customer Support, Third Party Services, Service Features, Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes and Choice of Law, Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties, Limitations of Our Liability, Indemnification, Waiver of Injunctive or Other Equitable Relief, Updates to Terms, and General Provisions, will survive.<br />\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Severability; Interpretation; Assignment.<br />\r\nIf any provision of these Terms, or any applicable Additional Terms, is for any reason deemed invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms or the Additional Terms, and the invalidity of the provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of these Terms or the Additional Terms.
